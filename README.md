SamplePhoneApp
==============
Steps to create a new sample project:

  1. cordova create SamplePhoneApp com.sample.app "SamplePhoneApp"
  2. cd SamplePhoneApp/
  3. cordova platform add android
  4. cordova build
  5. adb devices
  6. cordova run android


Once the 'hello-world' equivalent is loaded on the phone successfully, use this project to populate your www folder and run 'cordova run android' again. This will give you a webapp - with bootsrap, jquery and highcharts embedded
